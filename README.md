## Project description
This project compares the following models by their forecasting performance measured in out-of-sample mean-squared errors:
* Auto-regressive model
* OLS model
* Model averaging with equal weights
* Dynamic factor model
* Ridge model
* LASSO model
* Random forrest model
* Bayesian model averaging

## Data
This project uses two types of data:
* Data generated from a dynamic factor model
* U.S. inflation data
